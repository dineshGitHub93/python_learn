Dear Recipient’s

I want to sincerely apologize for the mistake I made earlier today. I meant to send a confidential document to just one person, but I accidentally sent it to everyone on the mail thread.
I understand the importance of keeping such information private, and I take full responsibility for this error. I’ve already reached out to the recipients and requested them to delete the document and not use or forward it in any way.
This was not intentional, and I truly regret the oversight. I will be more careful in the future and double-check recipients before sending any sensitive information.
Please let me know if there's anything further I should do to correct this.
